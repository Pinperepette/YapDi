# YapDi - Yet another python Daemon implementation #

## Overview ##

As the name implies YapDi is yet another python daemon implementation. Python 2.x didn't have a daemonizing module in the standard library. It is one of those rare few moudules python standard library lacked that put the phrase "batteries included" to shame but a critical one. There is [PEP 3143](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3143/) which introduces a daemonizing package to python 3.x standard library.

Python community is scattered with so many daemon implementations and this is one of them. This module is a modified version of a code originally posted [here](http://www.jejik.com/articles/2007/02/a_simple_unix_linux_daemon_in_python/). So any compliments should go there first.
